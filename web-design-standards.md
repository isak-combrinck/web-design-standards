# Web Development Standards

A concrete checklist for web developers to test their work against.

## The Standards

### Navigation

- Site navigation should always be visible. The user should never have to scroll to the top (or bottom) of a page to access it. This includes the user having to use a 'to top' button to jump back to the top of the page.

- No mobile menus on large screens. If there's enough space to display the whole navigation, display it. Don't hide the navigation within a menu that needs to be opened when there is enough room to display it.

### Jump on Long Pages

Long pages that have different sections should have a way for you to jump directly to the different sections. You should not have to scroll in search of a section.

### Left to Right

This is based on the fact that most languages are read from left to right. So yes, it applies to you and not following this standard is bad design, not creativity.

- Left is back, right forward.
  - If you are scrolling through content new content comes from the right, old content exits to the left.
  - Navigation elements that take you back belong between the middle and left side of the screen; they have no place on the right half of the screen. The opposite is true for navigational elements that take you forward, or on to the next. Again, left takes you back in time or to content you have already seen. Right side takes you to new content, either unseen or newer by date.
- Left is from, right is to.
  - Left is where you are taking it from, right is where you are putting it.

Note: nothing to do with right/left handedness.

### Respect People

- Don't show advertisements on your website.
- Don't display full screen notifications that ask people to sign up for a newsletter (or similiar). If your content is good enough they will come back.

## Glossary

**Navigation**: Any element used to traverse the site like the main navigation, secondary navigation, etc. Does not include links within text blocks.
