# Web Development Standards

A concrete checklist for web developers to test their work against.

## The Standards

I am aware that these standards set the bar really high. Not every web developer will be able to follow them in their entirity because most of us work for someone else. However, web design is not easy and it's not a niche. Good design comes at a cost. This means that you have to sacrifice beauty for usability (e.g. not hiding navigation menus on wide screens) and profit for beauty (not showing ads).

### 1. Navigation

- Site navigation should always be visible. The user should never have to scroll to the top (or bottom) of a page to access it. This includes the user having to use a 'to top' button to jump back to the top of the page.

- No mobile menus on large screens. If there's enough space to display the whole navigation, display it. Don't hide the navigation within a menu that needs to be opened when there is enough room to display it.

### Jump on Long Pages

Long pages that have different sections should have a way for you to jump directly to the different sections. You should not have to scroll in search of a section.

### Left to Right

This is based on the fact that most languages are read from left to right. So yes, it applies to you and not following this standard is bad design, not creativity.

- Left is back, right forward.
  - If you are scrolling through content new content comes from the right, old content exits to the left.
  - Navigation elements that take you back belong between the middle and left side of the screen; they have no place on the right half of the screen. The opposite is true for navigational elements that take you forward, or on to the next. Again, left takes you back in time or to content you have already seen. Right side takes you to new content, either unseen or newer by date.
- Left is from, right is to.
  - Left is where you are taking it from, right is where you are putting it.

Note: nothing to do with right/left handedness.

### Respect People

- Don't try to trick people with cookie banners.
- Don't show advertisements on your website. WHAT!? Yes. Advertisements seriously harm good design.
- Don't display full screen notifications that ask people to sign up for a newsletter (or similar). Rather, have a call-to-action button that's clearly visible but not intrusive. If your content is good enough they will come back.

### Minimal Requirements

The core functions of your website should work, even when **JavaScript** and **Cookies** are disabled.

E.g. if your website allows people to find and compare car rentals then you should be able to find, compare and rent a car with JavaScript and Cookies disabled. If you can also log in to save your searches and for faster checkout this doesn't need to work without JavaScript and Cookies because it's not the central function of your website.

## Glossary

**Navigation**: Any element used to traverse the site like the main navigation, secondary navigation, etc. Does not include links within text blocks.
