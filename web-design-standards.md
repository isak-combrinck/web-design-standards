# Web Design Standards

A concrete checklist for web developers to test their work against.

## Standards
- The site navigation should always be visible.
  - The user should never have to scroll to the top of a page to access it. This includes the user having to use a 'to top' button to jump back to the top of the page.

## Glossary
**Navigation**: Any element used to traverse the site like the main navigation, secondary navigation, etc. Does not include links within text blocks.
