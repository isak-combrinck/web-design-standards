# Web Design Standards

## Vision
To give web developers a concrete checklist that they can test their websites against to increase the quality of their work.

## Scope
These standards apply to websites that are viewed through a browser by the end user. Although many of the principles do carry over to user interface and app design those practices are beyond the scope of this project.
