# Web Design Standards

## Version: *Early Draft*

### Vision

To help web developers increase the quality of their work.

### Scope

These standards apply to websites that are viewed through a browser by the end user. Although many of the principles do carry over to user interface and app design, those practices are beyond the scope of this project.
